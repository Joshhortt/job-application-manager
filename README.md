## Description

_The goal of this simple Web page is to **keep track of your Job application process**_.<br/>
_After entering your name, you will be asked to click the button below, then you will_,<br/>
_get a written message from the recruiter. Whatever the message is_,<br/>
_you your name is going to show up several times inside the message_.<br/>
_The **second part** of the app you will confirm the Appointment by answering **yes** or **no** inside the form_.<br/>
_To confirm that you need to click the button **Send**, then you will get the answer **yes** or **no**_.<br/>
_in **UPPERCASE** and green color_.<br/>
_The **third part** of the app I added just for fun another form to fill out with your Birthday **Year**_.<br/>
_After you enter the given year in the form, you should click the button and you will get a message_.<br/>
_saying, that it **is** or **NOT** a **leap year**. If it is NOT, it will appear in *UPPERCASE** and red color_.
_The **fourth part** of the app, I added a survey with **radio buttons** to rate the platform_.<br/>
_The user after each question checks what he thinks about the platform. The scoreboard shows how much he just rated_.<br/>
_each question. At the end of it, the user knows how much he rated the platform_.
